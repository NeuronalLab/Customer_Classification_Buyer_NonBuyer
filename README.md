In this Repo, weâ€™ll construct a neural network to categorize customers as either buyers or non-buyers. Our dataset comprises information from 5000 customers, including details such as gender, age, income, province, and their purchase history.
Subsequently, weâ€™ll apply the trained model to classify 2500 new customers as potential buyers or non-buyers. This strategic approach aims to optimize our marketing budget by precisely targeting the right audience. ðŸš€
